Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any $T$ for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .
