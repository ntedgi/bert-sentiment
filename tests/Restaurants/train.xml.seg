I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the $T$ at the end of the meal .

I had a terrific $T$ , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .

Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty $T$ make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !

Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked $T$ !

While the $T$ was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .

I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .

The unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the food was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my $T$ looked like it might crawl off the plate .

The corned beef and $T$ are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
pastrami

The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire $T$ .

$T$ is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .

Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the $T$ , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .

The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the $T$ do n't look steamy hot as they should -LRB- also note lack of Chinese here -RRB- .

The chicken pot pie

I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring $T$ or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .

As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these $T$ were .

While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better $T$ in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .

my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - $T$ -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .

I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the $T$ are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional $T$ are only written in Chinese .

The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the $T$ would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .

The plain slice is great and if you get $T$ , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .

Interesting other dishes for a change include $T$ e and salmon caserole .

Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the $T$ was ridiculously small .

Overall , the ingredients and $T$ are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .

I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the $T$ are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .

To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the $T$ was ready .

When asked about how a certain $T$ was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
