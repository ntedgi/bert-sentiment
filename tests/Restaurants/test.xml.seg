The service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -LRB- horrible bartenders -RRB- , and the $T$ , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -LRB- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -RRB- getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .

I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an $T$ -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
