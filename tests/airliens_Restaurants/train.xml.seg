I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the $T$ at the end of the meal .

I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the $T$ -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
